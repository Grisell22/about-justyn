<p> There are other places in New York that people want to live in. One of them being the borough of Manhattan. Because so many people want to live here the rent is so high. A reason for this may be because everything is so close and together and you can find anything to do and anywhere to go around there</p>
<p> Some solutions  for my community would be to add clothing stores, pharmacies, movie theaters and restaurants around the neighborhood. These places should be walking distance. We can raise money for this by starting fund raisers and pitching our ideas to business companies who can start new stores</p>
<p> A place that incorporates these things while still being low rent is Washington Heights. The Heights has a lot of businesses and a sense of community that the bronx does not have. Because of this , even though both are low in rent citizens prefer to live in the heights instead of the Bronx </p>
